Python Challenge 3: Customer Banking

Purpose of the assignment: To create customer banking system where a user can track and calculate interest earned on a CD and Savings Account over a period of months. 

Applications: Python and VS Code

I learned: I learned how to apply my knowledge of Classes to build the customer banking system.

The challenges: This week I found the wording of the questions to be the most challenging. The terms of “pass”, “return”, and “call” are very new to me. I had to do additional reseach and use my resources to better understand what the questions were asking.
